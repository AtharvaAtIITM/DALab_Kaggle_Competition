## Assignment Details

### Objective
The quality of conversational AI agents hinges on practical, automated evaluation. In this competition, participants are tasked with building a metric learning model to predict the "fitness" or similarity score between a specific AI Evaluation Metric Definition and a corresponding Prompt-Response Text Pair.

The ability to accurately model this fitness is crucial for automatically generating and curating high-quality test datasets, ensuring that the test cases are genuinely aligned with the evaluation goals, and ultimately, building better, more reliable AI agents.

**Goal:** Given a metric definition (text embedding) and a prompt-response pair (text), predict the relevance or fitness on a scale of 1-10.
